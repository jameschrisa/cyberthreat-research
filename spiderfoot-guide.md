# SpiderFoot: Advanced Guide for Cyberthreat Vulnerability Research

## Introduction
SpiderFoot is a powerful open-source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. This guide focuses on using SpiderFoot effectively for researching cyberthreat vulnerabilities and exploits.

## Getting Started

1. Installation:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot.git
   cd spiderfoot
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Launch SpiderFoot:
   ```
   python3 ./sf.py -l 127.0.0.1:5001
   ```

3. Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`

## Effective Usage for Vulnerability Research

### 1. Configuring Scans

- Use "All" scan type for comprehensive results
- Focus on specific modules for targeted research:
  - sfp_vuln: Searches for vulnerabilities
  - sfp_exploitdb: Checks Exploit-DB for known exploits
  - sfp_filemeta: Analyzes metadata in files for potential info leaks

### 2. Key Modules for Vulnerability Discovery

- sfp_crossref: Identifies relationships between different data elements
- sfp_shodan: Integrates Shodan data for exposed services
- sfp_censys: Utilizes Censys.io for additional internet-wide scanning data
- sfp_zoomeye: Incorporates ZoomEye search engine results

### 3. Advanced Search Strings

- Use `VULNERABILITY:[CVE-ID]` to search for specific vulnerabilities
- Combine search terms: `DOMAIN:example.com AND VULNERABILITY:CVE-2021`
- Use regular expressions: `/apache.+2\.4\.[0-9]+/` to find specific versions

### 4. Analyzing Results

1. Check the "Correlations" tab for interconnected data points
2. Review "Vulnerabilities" section for potential security weaknesses
3. Examine "Raw Data" for detailed information on each finding

### 5. Integrating with Other Tools

- Use SpiderFoot's API for automation and integration
- Export results in various formats (CSV, JSON) for further analysis

## Best Practices for Cyberthreat Research

1. Start with a broad scan, then narrow focus based on initial results
2. Use custom lists of indicators (IPs, domains) for targeted scans
3. Leverage SpiderFoot HX (commercial version) for advanced features like continuous monitoring
4. Correlate SpiderFoot findings with other threat intelligence sources
5. Regularly update SpiderFoot and its modules for the latest capabilities
6. Use virtual environments or sandboxes when investigating potentially malicious targets

## Advanced Techniques

1. Custom Module Development:
   - Create Python scripts in the `modules` directory
   - Use the `sfp_template.py` as a starting point

2. Chaining Modules:
   - Use output from one module as input for another
   - Example: Domain discovery → Vulnerability scan → Exploit search

3. Passive vs. Active Scanning:
   - Use passive modules for stealthy reconnaissance
   - Active modules provide more data but may alert the target

4. Utilizing SpiderFoot Command Line:
   ```
   python3 ./sf.py -m sfp_vuln,sfp_shodan -s example.com -q
   ```

Remember, always conduct your research ethically and within legal boundaries. SpiderFoot is a powerful tool, and with great power comes great responsibility.
