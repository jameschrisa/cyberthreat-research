- Analyze website behavior, content, and network connections
- Identify potential phishing sites or compromised web pages

**Goals:**
- Detect malicious websites and web-based threats
- Understand the structure and behavior of web applications
- Support incident response and threat hunting activities

### 3. [SpiderFoot](spiderfoot-guide.md)

**Purpose:** Open-source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool

**Scope:** Comprehensive data collection from various online sources

**How researchers use it:**
- Gather extensive information about targets (domains, IPs, individuals)
- Automate the OSINT collection process
- Correlate data from multiple sources for deeper insights

**Goals:**
- Streamline the reconnaissance phase of security assessments
- Uncover hidden relationships and potential security risks
- Enhance the efficiency and breadth of OSINT gathering

### 4. [Maltego](maltego-guide.md)

**Purpose:** Data mining and visual link analysis tool

**Scope:** Complex data correlation and visualization

**How researchers use it:**
- Visualize relationships between different pieces of information
- Integrate data from various sources into a unified graph
- Conduct link analysis to uncover non-obvious connections

**Goals:**
- Enhance understanding of complex datasets and relationships
- Support investigative work in cybersecurity and threat intelligence
- Facilitate the discovery of patterns and anomalies in large datasets

### 5. [Recon-ng](recon-ng-guide.md)

**Purpose:** Reconnaissance framework

**Scope:** Modular approach to information gathering and OSINT

**How researchers use it:**
- Conduct web-based reconnaissance
- Automate the process of gathering information about targets
- Customize and extend functionality through modules

**Goals:**
- Standardize and streamline the reconnaissance process
- Facilitate rapid information gathering for security assessments
- Support both passive and active information collection techniques
